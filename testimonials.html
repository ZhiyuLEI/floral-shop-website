        <p> Here is what our clients said about Floral Flower Shop service. </p>
        <div class="cleaner"></div>
        <blockquote><i>"What an absolutely fabulous company. From the website, to the app, to the gorgeous flower selections. I love how they keep it fun and simple. I ordered a $45 bouquet mix bouquet with Dahliahs (The Jules) yesterday at 4:30pm. No later than 6pm, it was delivered to my friend's house in Mt Albert. All the while - a little bloombot kept me in the loop with texts saying my order was on it's way, and finally delivered!! The fact that they use local, in season beauties keeps the cost affordable too - how smart! My friend was highly impressed with the colourful dahlia bouquet. I can't wait to send more!! " <br/>

        <blockquote><i>"I needed a florist to design a bouquet for my City Hall wedding. I sent out an email with my request and a picture of something I liked and when I heard back from Courtney, I just knew she got it. She wrote, "Springy, and loose garden bouquet with pops of color". She took the words right out of my mouth. The price was on par with the other quotes I received and the delivery was very reasonable. They were on time and accommodating. I definitely recommend! Thank you!!Debbiana Brown. Just a quick note to say that the flowers for my wife's birthday were absolutely amazing and their aroma still fills the house one week later. I will personally recommend you to as many people as I can. Well done." <br/>

         <blockquote><i>"This review is a long time coming. I have used Floral Web Store for 3 years now for any and all occasions! If there were 10 stars for rating, I would totally do it.<br/>
         Three years means: three anniversaries, three birthdays, 2 valentines day, and 2 mothers day celebration of using Courtney and Jason. What can I say, they never disappoint.<br/>
         To top it all off, Courtney also did the boutonniere for my husband and I's wedding last October. I had a strict requirement of simple, classic, and not tacky. Courtney came up with a simple yet elegant white rose boutonniere. I loved it so much that I asked her to make it again when I graduated with my Master's Degree last December.<br/>
         Their customer service skills are also of the chain. Both Courtney and Jason are very nice when you come in, or when you call them on the phone. They seem to remember who you are even if you only see them once but every 3-6 months. They make you feel like you have known them all these years. I am sad I moved out of Auckland because I can't just drop-in the day before (or more like, the day off of) an event and have them do an arrangement to get picked-up after work or delivered the same day. <br/>
         It is very nice to see a community store flourish like this. I hope many more choose to shop here and support local business!"<br/>

         <blockquote><i>"I will absolutely use Floral Shop again.  I ordered some flowers to give as a 'thank you' today.  I called in the morning and we spoke about the style, occasion, price range and size of the arrangement. They asked for color preferences since I wasn't too picky about using specific flowers.  I wanted to pick them up from the shop so that I could deliver them myself and the lovely woman on the phone asked what time I wanted them ready by and gave me the option to pay when I came in or over the phone.  I paid over the phone and when I came in to pick them up not only were they ready and waiting for me just to grab and run but the arrangement was more beautiful than I could have ever imagined.  It was like they were reading my mind as they put it together.  The flowers were arranged in a cute wooden container with a ribbon around it, giving it the perfect rustic-garden feel.  It was exactly what I wanted and the recipient is going to LOVE them.  Thank you guys!  So happy to have found my florist! "<br/>

         <blockquote><i>"Got flowers sent to me from here on Valentine's Day (the busiest day of the year for them I'm sure).  The flowers were delivered in the timeframe specified by the sender and I was told whomever took the order was very nice and patient.  Even offered a slew of appropriate things to put on a card for the occasion. <br/>
         The tulips were beautiful and lasted a bit over a week in my stuffy office.  It's an added bonus that the vase is made from recycled glass."<br/>
